if I want to add a trampoline thing I can:
	make my own instruction length disassembler
	or just rewrite the overwritten bytes every time
		I can't really do this because of race conditions
	or pull a full disassembler with me into the kernel
	or make a userspace daemon just for length disassembling

So maybe just get the syscall_table, and overwrite that
	For now I look in userspace before inserting the node with /boot/System.map
	Or I could find a reference to it maybe? That would be nice
		maybe at arch_syscall_addr
	Or I could do a bruteforce search
